# Changelog

## 1.0.0

Part 4, Advanced. The course is complete at 24 chapters.

- An MCP client written by hand, speaking the stdio transport, so tools other
  people wrote become tools this agent can use
- A tiny MCP server for testing, so the client can be proved to work with
  nothing installed from outside this repository
- Subagents, which are ordinary tools whose implementation runs another agent
- Parallel work through threads and one queue, with each event labelled by the
  job it came from
- An eval runner with mechanical checks and an optional judge, plus the
  agentpath eval command whose exit code lets continuous integration refuse a
  change that made the agent worse
- Lessons 19 to 23 in English and Thai

## 0.3.0

Part 3, The Harness.

- A permission system that remembers an answer instead of asking again
- Sessions saved as JSONL, written as the run happens rather than at the end
- Context management that treats a tool call and its result as one unit, so
  trimming can never leave a result with no call in front of it
- Token accounting taken from what the provider reports rather than guessed
- Retrieval, and a chapter about when not to use it
- Retries that respect Retry-After and carry jitter, plus cancellation that
  stops real work rather than only the display
- Lessons 12 to 18 in English and Thai

## 0.2.0

Part 2, Real Tools.

- File tools with one gate deciding which paths may be touched, and an editor
  that refuses an ambiguous match
- A shell tool that asks before it runs anything
- Search by file name and by content, and the argument for why that beats a
  vector database for code
- A system prompt that states the facts the model cannot see
- Lessons 07 to 11 in English and Thai

## 0.1.0

Part 1, Foundations.

- One HTTP request to a model, with nothing hiding the wire
- Conversation history, tool calling, and the agent loop
- Streaming, including reassembling tool arguments that arrive in fragments
- One agent loop that works with two different provider dialects
- Lessons 00 to 06 in English and Thai
